download serverside.py to your server download log.txt or just make it yourself with

$touch log.txt


if your on linux get you local ip on the server

windows: ipconfig

linux hostname -I

put the local ip in the clientside.py file and run it, it will make a connection and you should be good to start messaging, if you want a terminal program jsut install clientside.py if you want a app with a ui just download clientside-gui.py each should run bythemself with only default ython libraries
